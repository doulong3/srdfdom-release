ros-kinetic-srdfdom (0.3.1-0wily) wily; urgency=high

  * Change logError to Warn if collision link missing #10 <https://github.com/ros-planning/srdfdom/issues/10> Since MoveIt continues to load anyway, it makes sense to change the unknown collision link pairs ROS Error to a ROS Warning. Everything continues to work if a specified set of collision-link pairs is missing.
